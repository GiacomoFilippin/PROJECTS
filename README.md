this is a series of project that were conducted by myself, either alone or in group.
the list includes two types of projects:
-personal: these are projects that are not related to my accademic path, that i conducted
           because i was curious about the topic. (bische, poker)
           these are generally more complex and ambitious, altough maybe less structured.
-accademic: these are projects that i did during my studies at Universit√† degli studi di Padova.
            These are generally simpler, more "scholastic" projects, that still showcases some of
            my work, experience and competence.
